Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
                        <p><strong>Embedded Scripts</strong>.An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
                        <h6>Purchases Made Through Our Sites</h6>
                        <p>We may contract with third parties to provide services such as online order selection and fulfilment services for the products available on our Sites ("Products"). You acknowledge and agree that you may be leaving our Sites to select Products and place your Product order. Such third parties' websites are subject to such sites' policies, and when you are on those sites, those sites' privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy govern the collection of information from you.</p>
                        <h6>Personal Information from Other Sources</h6>
                        <p>We may from time to time supplement the information we collect about you online with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or information you provided to us through one of our retail stores, including, without limitation, in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. Thus, information we obtain may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through other sources, including both offline and online sources. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have stated otherwise.</p>
                        <p>You may also choose to participate in a third party application (such as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application on a third party web site) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information. The third party may allow you to remove the application, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application, but we may retain the information previously collected. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "friends" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your friend's web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or interactive service.</p>

                        <h6>Use of Information</h6>

                        <p>Further, we may use third party analytics and other service providers to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Sites and viewing of our content. We do not share Personal Information with these analytics service providers, but they may set and access their own tracking technologies and methods such as cookies, web beacons and embedded scripts on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information. This Privacy Policy does not govern such third-party tracking technologies but does govern our collection and use of your Usage Information we receive in connection therewith.</p>
                        <p>Please note that when you submit information to the Sites via a "contact us" or other similar function, you may not always receive a response. We will not use the information provided to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request unless you agree otherwise.</p>
                        <h3>Disclosure of Information</h3>

Except as set forth in Section (f) below, we do not share your Personal Information with third parties for those third parties' marketing purposes unless you consent to such sharing at the time you provide your Personal Information.

                        <p><b>(a)</b> When You Agree to Receive Information From Third Parties. You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers directly from third parties. If you do agree (or, as applicable, do not decline) to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to such third parties and all information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of such third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third parties and, therefore, you should review the privacy policies and practices of such third parties prior to agreeing to receive such information from third parties. If you later decide that you no longer want to receive communication from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.</p>
                        <p><b>(b)</b> Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf. We may use third party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of the Sites, such as hosting the Sites, designing and/or operating the Sites' features, tracking Site analytics, enabling you to purchase Products and enabling E-LAVISH to send you email newsletters or perform other administrative services. We may provide these companies with access to user information, including Personal Information, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for E-LAVISH.</p>
                        <p>(c) Co-branded Areas. Certain areas of the Sites may be provided to you in association with third parties ("Co-Branded Areas") and may require you to disclose Personal Information in order to register for and access Products. Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third-party associates. If you elect to register for Products and/or services at Co-Branded Areas, you may be providing your information to both E-lavish and the third party associates. Further, if you sign-in to a Co-Branded Area with a username and password obtained on the Sites, your Personal Information may be disclosed to the identified third party associates for that Co-Branded Area and will be subject to the posted privacy policies.</p>
                        <p>(d) Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions. We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a "Promotion") through the Sites that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the terms, conditions and official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfilment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules, such as on a winners list.</p>
                        <p>(e) Administrative and Legal Reasons. We may transfer and disclose your information, including Personal Information, to third parties: (i) in the event we are required to respond to subpoenas or other legal process or if in our good faith opinion such disclosure is required by law; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (iii) to protect and/or defend the Sites' Terms of Use or other policies applicable to the Sites; or (iv) to protect the personal safety, rights, property or security of any individual. We may also use IP address or other Device Identifiers to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, internet service providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies in our discretion. Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.</p>
                        <p>(f) Business Transfer. E-LAVISH may share Personal Information with its parent and its and their subsidiaries and affiliates.

                        <p>When you receive promotional emails from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving such communications from us and you will have the opportunity to "opt-out" by following the instructions in the applicable email. If we contact you by telephone for promotional purposes, you may notify us at that time if you do not wish to receive further promotional telephone communications. Note that if you've provided multiple forms of contact information at different times, you may have to opt out for each set of contact information that you have added to your account. If you don't want to reply to an e-mail or you receive, or want a simpler way to opt out of receiving e-mails from us, you can just tell us what you want by contacting:</p>

                        <p>When you use the Sites, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control.
